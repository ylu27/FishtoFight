User guide for ado files:
Ado files are Stata command files that contain programming code to this replication project. To use ado files, you can follow these steps:
1. Find the appropriate directory: Open Stata and type "adopath" in the command window. This command will display a list of directories where Stata searches for ado files. Look for the "PLUS" or "PERSONAL" directory in the output. These directories are intended for user-installed ado files.
2. Copy the ado file: Locate the downloaded ado file on your computer, and copy it.
3. Paste the ado file: Navigate to the "PLUS" or "PERSONAL" directory you identified in Step 1, and paste the copied ado file into that directory.
